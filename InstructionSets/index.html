      <p>XYZ is a series of graphically striking black and white painted cardboard tetris boxes that were grouped in Tompkins Square Park to redirect pedestrian traffic as it flows through the park. The project plays off the redesign of Tompkins Square in
        the 1930’s which intended to separate large mass gatherings and prevent political mobilization. In XYZ, park goers moved the boxes around, created arches, and  gathered for play, or alternately felt apprehensive and distracted. In addition, the
        clusters of boxes visually lured or deterred park-goers, creating new paths, connections, and flows in the park.</p>

      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>From salt marsh to rioting hub, from needle park to gentrified playground, Tompkins Square Park has a robust and highly diverse history. The original layout of the park was catered to training the New York National Guard, but the current layout,
        constructed in 1936 by Robert Moses was created with the intent to divide and manage large crowds from gathering following the many riots and protest. Interestingly, this new layout did not change the politically charged history of the park that
        followed. Taking into account this history, we decided to locate our intervention in Tompkins Square Park. This allowed us to play with the political connotations that piece might have as well as further investigate the flow of people.</p>

        <p>Interaction I of XYZ was a grouping of interactable white cardboard boxes of different sizes distributed across a bottleneck passageway in Tompkins Square Park. We used this iteration to observe and test our hypothesis of whether a small obstacle
          creates a temporary community between people in transit. Each box could be shifted with slight human movement, but changing the overall shape of the object required either moving each box individually, or pushing one box into the other. During
          the intervention, we observed a number of different interactions. We asked the audience to slow down, change course, and interact with the piece, and in doing so reorient themselves and their role in the park. The interaction facilitated connection
          between the community, but also led us to believe that there can be more effective ways to create positive engagement.</p>

        <p>We created a more playful but organized interactive experience by using a semi-structured grid system and puzzle-like groupings rather than a single block-aid structure.
          By creating an experience that offered structure but also agency to the users, we were able to witness less but more impactful interactions. Thus, shifting how people moved through and engaged with Tompkins Square Park.
