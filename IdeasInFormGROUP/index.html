          <h3>Research Statement</h3>
          <p>Our research is to explore the intersectionality between aesthetics and functionality within wearable technology. Can they go hand in hand? Are they in competition with one another? Lastly, how fluidly could these machines function in an environment?</p>

            <p>Article is about what’s next for fashion and technology - besides watches. High fashion is more concerned with design and aesthetics and may be less comfortable with using technology if it is not serving their design well. “The problem is still
              that, a few smart sportswear items aside, no one is really sure exactly what role technology should play in the rest of our wardrobe. What do we want our clothes to do, beyond what they already do?” This article was helpful in seeing how the
              fashion world may see the technology world and how although in theory the intersection is easy it is more complicated than just throwing some sensors on a t-shirt. To understand how these two fields can intersect we have to understand the
              motivations of each.

            <p>The author investigates the importance of wearability in wearable technology. She argues that technology should be included in the production of the garments (weaved into the fabric, etc.) and not added later on since it disrupts the comfort
              of the user thus affecting its functionality and decreases the aesthetic appeal of the garment.</p>

            <p>Article talks about wearable technology as a benefit to society and something that can hinder it. The author talks about how he isn’t good at multitasking and how having everything you need to do your work on your person could help with this
              because you do not need to think as much about the things you need for your work and can access things faster. Having all of this access is a good thing but also can provide an obscene number of distractions if you are walking around with
              glasses that give you access to the internet legitimately on your face.</p>

            <p>This article expands on the importance of aesthetics in wearable technologies with a more personal twist. They take special consideration on the user and their needs/tastes. They argue that wearable technology is not successful and will no be
              marketable if it doesn’t adapt and accommodate to its user.</p>

            <p>Author writes about apple buying a startup that is focused on AR glasses. As well at tech the company wants to create glasses that are actually visually appealing and that the user would want to wear. The article talks about how the glasses
              are thin and lightweight and carry a similar aesthetic to normal glasses - this may make an easier transition to wearing them since they are a familiar feeling to the wearer if they have ever worn glasses/sunglasses. In this case the aesthetics
              are important to the creator as well as creating functional technology. There is a clear understanding that the buyer is interested in having a cool piece of technology but will not want to walk around with giant bulky glasses on their face
              that will be more distracting than useful. “Producing crystal clear optical displays thin and light enough to fit into glasses similar to everyday frames with images bright enough for outdoor use and suited to mass manufacturing at a relatively
              low price.”

            <p>Levi x Apple jacket collaboration was not successful - although it looked good and was aesthetically appealing the technology did not work well enough for people to want to use it. This is an example of how, for a wearable technology garment
              to be successful it needs to be equally wearable and technologically sound. In this case the aesthetic value overpowered the technological development and created flaws that ultimately squashed the entire project.

            <p>The idea of using technology to create something that translates as a second sort of skin. This skin would then operate as an interface that interacts directly with the world around it and changes its shape accordingly. In theory, it could be
              a tool used to define social issues such as intimacy, gender and personal identities. The first component being the materiality of the fabricated skin itself. It’s meant to emulate the original flexibility of the thing (human skin) while showcasing
              other various bodily behaviors. This tech is assembled as a living copy of a muscle system using (SMA) Shape Memory Alloy actuators.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this device is essentially to get consumers to take more notice of the amount of sun they are exposed to. Having a constant reminder of this (hopefully) reducing the risk they have of skin cancer. The device is small and meant
              to rest on the consumers thumbnail. The information gained through the device is transferred to an app via (NFC) Near Field Communication a wireless technology that works similarly to contactless payment systems. Through this, the user is
              warned when they have had too much sun exposure and should be weary.</p>
